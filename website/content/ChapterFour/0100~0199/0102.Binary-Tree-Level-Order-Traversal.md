# [102. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-level-order-traversal/)

## 题目


Given a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (ie, from left to right, level by level).

**For Example**:

Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],

```

    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7

```

return its level order traversal as:

```

[
  [3],
  [9,20],
  [15,7]
]

```
 

## 题目大意

按层序从上到下遍历一颗树。

## 解题思路

用一个队列即可实现。

BFS Left->Right Top->Bottom

     1
    / \
   2   3
  / \
 4   5

Let's keep nodes of each tree level in the queue structure, which typically orders elements in a **FIFO (first-in-first-out)** manner. In Java one could use LinkedList implementation of the Queue interface. In Python using Queue structure would be an overkill since it's designed for a safe exchange between multiple threads and hence requires locking which leads to a performance loose. In Python the queue implementation with a fast atomic ``append()`` and ``popleft()`` is ``deque``.

The zero level contains only one node root. The algorithm is simple :

- Initiate queue with a root and start from the level number 0 : level = 0.

- While queue is not empty :

    - Start the current level by adding an empty list into output structure levels.

    - Compute how many elements should be on the current level : **it's a queue length**.

        - Pop out all these elements from the queue and add them into the current level.

        - Push their child nodes into the queue for the next level.

    - Go to the next level level++.




## 代码
### BFS Iteration
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution(object):
    def levelOrder(self, root):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: List[List[int]]
        """
        #initialize result, queue and level index
        
        levels=[]
        if not root:
            return levels
        queue = deque([root,])
        level=0
        while queue:
            #adding emtpy list to current level
            levels.append([])
            #get the number of ele in the current level
            level_length = len(queue)
            #pop current level
            for i in range (level_length):
                node = queue.popleft()
                levels[level].append(node.val)
                #push the child node
                if node.left:
                    queue.append(node.left)
                if node.right:
                    queue.append(node.right)
            #level++
            level = level+1
        return levels

```
